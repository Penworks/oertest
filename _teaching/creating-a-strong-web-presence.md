A short presentation to provide either students or staff from related digital media or education backgrounds what is entailed in building a web presence. This can be modified to the audience's areas of interest and general focus. Here there are issues relating to ecommerce, which may not be useful for educators. In that case a supplementary section could be added relating to online learning resources or how to build learning networks.
