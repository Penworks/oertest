I currently live in Malta, after around 30 years as a Londoner. I’m a former lecturer in web apps and multimedia and senior lecturer in technology enhanced learning in UK higher education, working for in total eleven years at London Metropolitan University, a large urban widening participation university. When I worked there between 2006-2015 we had a community of 40,000 people and spoke 180 languages. In my time since coming to Malta I have pursued a full time PhD and also had the pleasure of lecturing at University of Malta in various capacities to both undergrad and postgrad students. I also spent some time as a senior research support officer for an Erasmus+ knowledge transfer project concerning change managemnt for F2F courses to distance learning programmes in West Balkans universities. This work focused on technology solutions and pedaogical practice in online learning.

I completed a PhD in smart learning (2021), investigating how people learn using augmented reality and creative activities. 

I’ve carried out large scale website usability,  user experience and technical functionality testing evaluations on a few cool projects. I learned a lot.

I’ve made a lot of websites and still make one or two now, as well as other digital content. I have worked with Wordpress, ExpressionEngine, Drupal, with Grunt workflow. I now work with Grav, Jekyll and soon Eleventy/11ty. My PhP isn’t pretty, but it works nice and is secure. I undersand Twig and Liquid. I’m quite technical but Im not a pro webdev, Im a hacker.
