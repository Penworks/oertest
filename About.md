I’m a former lecturer in web apps and multimedia and senior lecturer in technology enhanced learning in UK higher education, working for in total eleven years at London Metropolitan University, a large urban widening participation university. When I worked there btween 2006-2015 we had a community of 40,000 people and spoke 180 languages.

I have a PhD in smart learning (2021), investigating how people learn using augmented reality and creative activities.

I’ve carried out large scale website evaluations and usability testing on a few cool projects. I learned a lot.

I’ve made a lot of websites and still make one or two now, as well as other digital content. I work with Wordpress, ExpressionEngine and Drupal, often using Grunt workflow. My PhP isn’t pretty, but it works nice and is secure. I’m quite technical.
