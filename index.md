This is a repository of Open Educational Resources created over the past 10 years by Pen Lister. Content can be viewed from this Github Pages site, or using the front end available from my website at [https://penworks.net](https://penworks.net). All content is licensed under a CC BY SA NC licence - you can make derivatives, use the site as a source of ideas and inspiration, take sections from PDFs etc, but always please credit. Please don't use anything for commercial contexts without my prior permnission.

Some of the content is here as a historic record and may not be current. That said, it may still beof interest. Ill try to create a unique url (page) for each main piece of content, i.e. slides, or collections of related teaching content. That will provide some background on when things were initially published and used.
