*December 2024*

This is a repository of Open Educational Resources created by Pen Lister approximately over the past decade, in the context of lecturing and extra curricula projects in London UK and Malta higher education. All content is licensed under a CC BY SA NC license - you can make derivatives, use the site as a source of ideas and inspiration, take sections from PDFs etc, but always please credit me. Please don't use anything for commercial contexts without my prior permnission. Some of the content is here as a historic record and may not be current. That said, it may still be of interest. 

Content can be viewed from this Github Pages site, or using the OER area (soon to be available) from my website at [https://penworks.net](https://penworks.net). Ill try to create a unique url (page) for each main piece of content, i.e. slides, or collections of related teaching content. This will provide some background on when things were initially published and used. 

*Site design here uses Jekyll Minima with small modification and customisation. Design seeks to be as minimal as possible, as the site is primarily a repository of work.*
