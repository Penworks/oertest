This is a repository of Open Educational Resources created by Pen Lister over approximately the past decade, in the context of lecturing and extra curricula projects in London UK and Malta higher education. All content is licensed under a CC BY SA NC license - you can make derivatives, use the site as a source of ideas and inspiration, take sections from PDFs etc, but always please credit me. Please don't use anything for commercial contexts without my prior permnission. Some of the content is here as a historic record and may not be current. That said, it may still be of interest. 

Content can be viewed and downloaded using this Github Pages site, or using the OER area (soon to be available) from my website at [https://penworks.net](https://penworks.net). There is a unique url (page) for each main piece of content, i.e. slides, reports or other material. This will provide a summary and /or some background on when things were initially published and used. 

The site also acts as a portfolio of work, to showcase my approach to creating content, often utilising the 'reusable learning object' mrthod to designing and developing lecture slides. This makes each slidedeck more versatile to use in multiple teaching contexts for different modules and learning levels. 

*Site design here uses Jekyll Minima with small modification and customisation. Design seeks to be as minimal as possible, as the site is primarily a repository of work.*
