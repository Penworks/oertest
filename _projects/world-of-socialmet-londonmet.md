The SocialMet Project ran fromm 2010 to 2012 at London Metropolitan University. It was a student staff informal partnership to affect change within the academic community and contribute to feedback for the development of the Student and Staff charters. The project was convened by the Strategic Programme Office, under the auspicesof Dr C. Sarchet, and I was commisioned to run a project to 'find out what students thought about university life'.
